## About 

Under the wisdom of our fearless leader we prepare to arm the next wave of recruits with 
the tricks and techniques they will need to hold off the constant onslaught of demos and POC requests. 

If you want to learn about managing data on Oracle cloud, feel free to follow along! 


## Getting Started 

These tutorials will assume you have an Oracle Cloud account. If you don't, you can create a trial account 
[here](https://cloud.oracle.com/tryit). If you're a new-hire (or have a Oracle Cloud SE on hand) ask them and they'll help 
you get set up. 

Even if you're relatively untechnical this content should not be too difficult to follow. If you 
do get confuse please let us know or submit a pull request :heart:
