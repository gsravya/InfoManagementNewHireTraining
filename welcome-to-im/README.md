# Welcome to IM! 
## DIRECTIONS
:see_no_evil: :hear_no_evil: :speak_no_evil:

I hope you like acronyms, because we use a lot of them :imp:

## Series 1 - Basics
Before we dive into any services let's do a quickly run over some basic 
computer stuff you'll need to know. If you miss some of it, don't worry 
you'll be able to refer back here later. Also, the whole of the internet is 
at your disposal. 

### Git & Docs
Welcome to your first challange. This should be easy :smiley:
1. Take a look at the resources on
[extra-credit.md](extra-credit.md). 
1. Go find one of your own. It can be anyting cool (Good 
documentation [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), 
[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com), [Github](https://github.com/)).
1. Fork this repository, add your resource, and then make a 
pull request. 
    * If you need help ask anybody:raising_hand:, and if you finish quickly 
    get to know your neighbor (and maybe help them:exclamation:)

If you see more opportunities to contribute to these docs please 
feel free. Small improvements build over time and are excelent practice :+1:

### Ravello & VMs
Hopefully you've got your 
[ravello account](https://cloud.ravellosystems.com/) set up. 
If not, we'll just use a local VM. 
1. Find an [Oracle Linux](https://www.oracle.com/linux/index.html) image
1. Set up and log into your VM!

### OS Basic
You're going to get to know linux :sparkles:
![](../common/what-are-clouds-made-of.jpg) [1]  
Some things we expect you to know: 
* How to navigate the filesystem (`cd`, `pwd`, `ls`)
* Users, Groups, and Permissions
* Software & Package Managers (`yum` for Oracle Linux)
* Environmental Variables (especielly the `$PATH`)

### Linux & Bash
You'll often need to find your way around an unframiliar VM 
so understanding how to get the most out of the linux shell will 
really give you a head start! 

### Networking - SSH, Public/Private key encryption, VNC
Hopefully you'll all already be framiliar with these techniques, 
and got to use VNC (maybe without knowing it) to log onto your Ravello
instance.

### Data Management tools on Oracle Cloud
Have you used any of these? Let us know! (Remember 
you can check [cloud.oracle.com](https://cloud.oracle.com/home) 
to see the latest portfolio)
1. Pick a service
1. Tell us when & why to use it
1. Give a few of the selling points for this service

## Series 2 - DBCS
[Oracle Database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Database) 
is unarguably one of the top databases in the world. It also happens to be 
Oracle's "bread and butter" so expect to get a lot of requests from customers 
to size or demo this. 


## Series 3 - ExaData 
More Oracle Database!

## Series 4 - ADWCS
Once more over Oracle Database. 

## Series 5 - BDC
:dancer: Oracles Big Data Cloud :raised_ands:

## Series 6 - Data Integration - Golden Gate, DIPC, EHCS

## Final - Putting it all together :grin:
